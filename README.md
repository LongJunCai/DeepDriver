# DeepDriver
This is a Deep Learning framework projects written with JAVA, including:
- ANN, the forward feed neural network
- DNN, a deep ANN
- CNN, the convNet, including LetNet, VGG, ResNet, FNN, and so on.
- RNN/LSTM, used for sequential strings handeling
- Bi-LSTM
- W2V supports also is added already
- Encoder-Decoder framework and so on.
- add supporting for DNC(Differential Neural Computer) DeepDriver/src/deepDriver/dl/aml/dnc/

This framework provides some examples:
- NLP: Chinese word segmentation
- CNN txt classification
- QA samples
